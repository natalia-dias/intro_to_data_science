<h2>Removing elements from Series</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p></p>
<p>Imagine you have a <code class="java">Series</code> called <code class="java">olympics</code> that stores the names of the cities hosting the Summer Olympics between 2000 and 2020. The index is set to the year of the games (as an integer), and the city names are represented as strings. Here is a fragment of the <code class="java">Series</code>:</p>
<pre>2000            Sydney
2004            Athens
...
2020             Tokyo
dtype: object</pre>
<p>However, the games of 2020 were cancelled because of the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>Define a function that removes the corresponding row from the <code class="java">olympics</code> and returns the resulting <code class="java">Series</code> object.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
