<h2>Penguins on vacation</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p></p>
<p>Let's say our penguins want to travel around the world, and their preferred method of transportation is the airplane. Planes have a weight limit, and our antarctic friends need a special type of environment on a plane, so we have to decide how many planes will be needed to transport them comfortably. We'll use the dataset from the theory section:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight"> 	species    island 	bill_length_mm 	bill_depth_mm 	flipper_length_mm 	body_mass_g 	sex
0 	Adelie 	Torgersen 	          39.1 	         18.7 	            181.0 	     3750.0    MALE
1 	Adelie 	Torgersen 	          39.5 	         17.4 	            186.0 	     3800.0  FEMALE
2 	Adelie 	Torgersen 	          40.3 	         18.0 	            195.0 	     3250.0  FEMALE</code></pre>
<p>Select the valid ways to obtain the total weight of all penguins in kilograms(the unit of<code class="java">body_mass_g is</code> is grams). Suppose there are no external function imports unless they are specified in the option.</p>
