<h2>Calculating profit</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p></p>
<p>Imagine that you are doing analytics for some manufacturer.</p>
<p>You collected the data for the past several months. Production costs for each month are stored in the <code class="java">costs</code> list, while total revenues per month are collected in a list called <code class="java">revenues</code>. Finally, the names of the months the data was collected in are stored in the <code class="java">months</code> list.</p>
<p>Compute and print out the profit of the manufacturer for each month. The output should look as follows:</p>
<p>Jan 1000<br/>
Feb 1500<br/>
etc.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b>  Profit is defined as the difference between revenue and production costs </p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
