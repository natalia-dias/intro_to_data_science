<h2>The island view</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p></p>
<p>We have a <code class="java">DataFrame</code> which contains the date, the island name, and a count of how many times a certain penguin-like creature was seen on that particular date on the island. Here is the head sample:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">        date  island  count
0 2022-09-01    Java     12
1 2022-09-02  Taiwan      1
2 2022-09-03  Taiwan     34
3 2022-09-04   Luzon     33
4 2022-09-05   Luzon      7</code></pre>
<p>Select the line that will return the count of the unique islands. Suppose we did not write or import any additional functions.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> Carefully review the <em>DataFrame.aggregate</em> theory section</p>
</div>
